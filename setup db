To create a user and grant all access on a specific MySQL database, follow these steps:

1. **Connect to your MySQL server** using a command-line client like `mysql` or a tool like phpMyAdmin or MySQL Workbench.
2. **Create a new user** and grant it the necessary permissions:

   ```sql
   CREATE USER 'kalpit'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
   ```

   Replace `'kalpit'` with the desired username and `'password'` with a secure password of your choice.

3. **Grant all privileges to the new user** for a specific database:

   ```sql
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON pipeline.* TO 'kalpit'@'localhost';
   ```

   Here, `pipeline` is the name of your MySQL database. If you want to grant access from any host, use `%` instead of `localhost`:

   ```sql
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON pipeline.* TO 'kalpit'@'%';
   ```

4. **Flush the privileges** to make the changes take effect:

   ```sql
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

Now, your Go application can connect to the MySQL database using the credentials specified in `dbConnectionStr`.

Here's the modified `dbConnectionStr` used in your Go code:

```go
dbConnectionStr = "kalpit:password@tcp(localhost:3306)/pipeline"
```

Make sure to replace `kalpit`, `password`, `localhost`, and `pipeline` with your actual username, password, MySQL host, and database name.
